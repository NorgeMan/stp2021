We can be heroes everywhere we go
There's a moment
You can get the gold
Keep your silver, give me that gold
Do it for your country

Oh-oh, I got stamina
Still, hanging in the balance
I’m free to be the greatest here tonight, the greatest
Oh whoa, we're unstoppable
Wanting it more

Standing in the hall of fameWanting it more
Some will call it luck
The greatest, the greatest alive
Oh whoa, we're unstoppable

Oh-oh, I got stamina
Still, hanging in the balance
I’m free to be the greatest here tonight, the greatest
Oh whoa, we're unstoppable
Wanting it more

The greatest, the greatest alive
Everybody praying for the end of times
We can have all that we ever want
Uh-oh, running now, I close my eyes
And the world’s gonna know your name (yeah)

Oh-oh, I got stamina
Still, hanging in the balance
I’m free to be the greatest here tonight, the greatest
Oh whoa, we're unstoppable
Wanting it more
