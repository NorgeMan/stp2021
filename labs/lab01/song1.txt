Over the edge
Feel like I'm floating through the air
The pain I felt is paid for, all is said and done, oh
I am restricted, fixed upon the web
I need to kick the habit
That my mind is breathing in

Break out I've got to see
(Break out I've got to see)
Spent all my life
Holding all of it closely
I played it innocent
A feel of discontent
I'm finally facing it all
Fearless
Fearless
Fearless
Fearless

Burning the bridge that keeps us
I'm here and I'm feeling fearless
Exaggerated that's what you assume
The story's over now
I must conclude

I am conflicted
Watching where I step
Still, hanging in the balance
Not the life I want to live
I want to take it all, standing tall
Fear outweighed the person you are, oh

Break out I've got to see
(Break out I've got to see)
Spent all my life
Holding all of it closely
I played it innocent
A feel of discontent
I'm finally facing it all
Fearless
(Fearless...)
